<h5>3. Cookies</h5>
<p>The Internet pages of the Sakthiya Nagaselvam use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer system via an Internet browser.</p><br>
<p>Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified by the unique cookie ID.</p><br>
<p>
  Through the use of cookies, the Sakthiya Nagaselvam can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

  By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized in the interests of the user. Cookies allow us, as already mentioned, to recognize the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter his access data every time he visits the website, because this is taken over by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online shop. The online shop remembers the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

  The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be fully usable.

</p>
<h5>8. Legal basis for processing</h5>
<p>
Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, for example to fulfill tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, it may be necessary to process personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our company were injured and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not outweigh them. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not outweigh them. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the person responsible (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).

</p><br>
<h5>9. Legitimate interests in the processing that are being pursued by the controller or a third party</h5>
<p>If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit.f GDPR, our legitimate interest is the conduct of our business activities for the benefit of all our employees and our shareholders.</p><br>
<h5>10. Duration for which the personal data will be stored</h5><br>
<p>The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the period has expired, the relevant data is routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer required for contract fulfillment or contract initiation.</p><br>

<h5>11. Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; Necessity for the conclusion of the contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of non-provision</h5>
<p>We explain to you that the provision of personal data is in part required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the contractual partner). In order to conclude a contract, it may sometimes be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data that we subsequently have to process. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data when our company concludes a contract with them. Failure to provide personal data would mean that the contract could not be concluded with the person concerned. Before the person concerned provides personal data, the person concerned must contact one of our employees.</p><br>
